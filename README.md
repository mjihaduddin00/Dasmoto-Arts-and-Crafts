# Dasmoto-Arts-and-Crafts
This is my project submission for an end-client that wanted their site styled with specific CSS elements. This assignment demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills.

Here are the client's specifications: https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Dasmoto-Arts-and-Crafts/
